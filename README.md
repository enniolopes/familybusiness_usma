# Family Business US Merge and Acquisition (M&A) Project

## Objective
Create a database that can be used to test the following assumptions:  
**(1)** Does ownership similarity affect target selection in M&A operations? (Bettinazzi et al 2018) [**H1.**]  
**(2)** Are there new deals if performance is not as expected in initial M&A operations? [**H2.**]  

## Scope - Work Breakdown Structure
**1. Map the project**  
      1.1. Scope  
      1.2. Timeline  
  
**2. Define variables**  
      2.1. [**H1.**] dependent variables  
      2.2. [**H1.**] indenpendent (explanatory) variables  
      2.3. [**H1.**] control variables  
      2.4. [**H2.**] dependent Variables  
      2.5. [**H2.**] indenpendent (explanatory) variables  
      2.6. [**H2.**] control variables  
  
**3. Define sample**  
      3.1. Data source  
      3.2. Restrictions (region, period, company types, and others)  
      3.3. Definition of computation of variables for [**H1.**]  
      3.4. Definition of computation of variables for [**H2.**]  
      3.5. Defining which variables to extract for [**H1.**]  
      3.6. Defining which variables to extract for [**H2.**]  
  
**4. Extract, read and merge samples (raw data) from source database**  
      4.1. Select all the targets variables and join fracted files  
      4.2. Merge all different databases  
      4.3. Test for integrity and consistence  
      4.4. Export merged file  
  
**5. Treat the raw data to tidy data**  
      5.1. Filter for restrictions from 2.2.  
      5.2. Treat missing values  
      5.3. Compute variables  
      5.4. Rename variables and fit the database for analysis  
      5.5. Export tidy data  
  
**6. Load the final data to analysis**  
      6.1. Check data documentation  
      6.2. Provide URL data and documentation
