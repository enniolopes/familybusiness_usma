# 2. Variables  
### [**H1.**] Ownership Similarity and Target Selection  
*Bettinazzi, E. L., Miller, D., Amore, M. D., & Corbetta, G. (2018). Ownership similarity in mergers and acquisitions target selection. Strategic Organization, 1476127018801294.*  
  
#### **2.1. Dependent Variable**  
**New Acquisition Occurrence** - variable that describes stake aquisitions from acquires that do NOT have participation on target firm (stake = 0%) defined into 3 acquisition levels: control, joint venture and minority aquisitions  
  
#### **2.2. Indenpendent Variables**  
**Ownership Correspondence** - dummy variable which assumes value 1 when the two firms share the same type of ownership before the deal (0 otherwise).  
*to assess the correspondence between acquirer and target firms, the type of ownership is classified as: 
(1) Corporate; 
(2) Mutual and pension fund, nominee, trust, trustee; 
(3) Financial company; 
(4) Bank; 
(5) Private equity firm; 
(6) Public authority, state, government; 
(7) Insurance company; 
(8) Family; 
(9) Hedge fund; 
(10) Venture capital; 
(11) Foundation, research Institute; 
(12) Self ownership; 
(13) Employees, managers, directors; 
(14) FREE-FLOAT.*  
    
**Ownership Commitment Similarity** - degrees of owner commitment and involvement with strategic decisions (such as acquisitions).  
*measured as the inverse of the absolute value of the difference between the score of acquirer and the one of the target, variable takes the value:*  
  *(3) have the same ownership commitment*  
  *(1 or 2) differ only moderately*  
  *(0) when they differ completely*  
*the score to the ownership commitment is:*  
  *(1) very low: firms controlled by financial investors (banks, private equity, or investment funds)*  
  *(2) mid-low: subsidiaries of foreign multinationals and state-owned firms*  
  *(3) mid-high: firms controlled by coalitions of private investors or cooperatives vis-à-vis family firms*  
  *(4) very high: family companies*  
  
  
**Family Involvement Similarity** - dyads composed of family owned and nonfamily owned firms are less similar than dyads where one firm is both owned and controlled by a family and the other is family owned only.  
variable takes the value:  
  *(2) high similarity: both firms are a part of the same cluster*  
  *(1) moderate similarity: both firms are family owned but only one of the two is controlled by the family*  
  *(-1) moderate dissimilarity: one of the two firms is family owned (but not controlled) and the counterpart is non-family owned*  
  *(-2) high dissimilarity: one of the two firms is non-family owned and the counterpart is family owned and controlled.*  
degree of family involvement the clusters:  
  *(A) family owned and family controlled*  
  *(B) family owned*  
  *(C) non-family owned*  
  
  
#### **2.3. Control Variables**  
**Geographical similarity** - geographical distance can have negative impact on the likelihood of acquisition between two firms.  
*to check if there is any institutional effect derived from the corporate law of each State and the quality of the enforcement of the contract*  
*dummy that takes the value of 1 if the two firms belong to the same state and 0 otherwise*  
    
  
**Relative performance** - absolute value of the difference between the firm’s ROA, divided by the absolute value of the sum of the two firms’ ROA, in the year before the acquisition  
  
**Relative size** - difference in size between the firms  
*absolute value of the difference in total assets between two firms, weighted by the sum of their total assets, in the year before the acquisition*  
  

**Business similarity** - similarity between the industry sectors in which two
firms operate  
*6-digit NAICS codes, Where the codes match at the 6-digit level a similarity value of 3 is assigned, where they match at 4 or 2-digit level, value 2 or 1 is assigned, respectively and 0 otherwise)*  
  
**Similarity Ownership Concentration** - ownership concentration can influence firm’s priorities, decision mechanisms, and in turn, performance.  
*ratio between the number of shareholders with more than 2% of shares of the acquiring firm and those of the target firm*  
  
  
**Industry Concentration** - firms in concentrated markets, particularly in related industries, may be more apt to pursue acquisitions to enhance profit margins  
*concentration of the sectors of the firms using the 50-firm concentration ratios of the NAICS 4-digit level*  
    
**Cash Slack** - Acquirer’s cash position  
*current assets of the acquiring firm*  
  
  
### [**H2.**] Deals Increments and Performance  
#### **2.4. Dependent Variable**  
**Deal Increment Occurrence** - variable that describes stake aquisitions from acquires that ALREADY have participation on target firm (stake > 0%) defined in 3 acquisition levels: control, joint venture and minority aquisitions  
  
#### **2.5. Indenpendent Variables**  
The same from 2.2.  
  
#### **2.6. Control Variables**  
The same from 2.3.
