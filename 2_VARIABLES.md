# 2. Variables  
### [**H1.**] Ownership Similarity and Target Selection  
*Bettinazzi, E. L., Miller, D., Amore, M. D., & Corbetta, G. (2018). Ownership similarity in mergers and acquisitions target selection. Strategic Organization, 1476127018801294.*  
  
#### **2.1. Dependent Variable**  
**Acquisition Occurrence** - dummy variable that describes if the acquisition occurred (acquisition implies control). If the final shareholding is greater than 50% and the initial is less than 50% the Dummy assumes value 1 (0 otherwise).  
  
#### **2.2. Indenpendent Variables**  
**Ownership Correspondence** - dummy variable which assumes value 1 when the two firms share the same type of ownership before the deal (0 otherwise).  
*to assess the correspondence between acquirer and target firms, the type of ownership is classified as: (1) family; (2) foreign multinational; (3) coalition of private investors; (4) cooperative; (5) private equity, investment funds; (6) banks; and (7) state or local municipalities*  
  
**Ownership Commitment Similarity** - degrees of owner commitment and involvement with strategic decisions (such as acquisitions).  
*measured as the inverse of the absolute value of the difference between the score of acquirer and the one of the target, variable takes the value:*  
  *(3) have the same ownership commitment*  
  *(1 or 2) differ only moderately*  
  *(0) when they differ completely*  
*the score to the ownership commitment is:*  
  *(1) very low: firms controlled by financial investors (banks, private equity, or investment funds)*  
  *(2) mid-low: subsidiaries of foreign multinationals and state-owned firms*  
  *(3) mid-high: firms controlled by coalitions of private investors or cooperatives vis-à-vis family firms*  
  *(4) very high: family companies*  
  
  
**Family Involvement Similarity** - dyads composed of family owned and nonfamily owned firms are less similar than dyads where one firm is both owned and controlled by a family and the other is family owned only.  
*variable takes the value:*  
  *(2) high similarity: both firms are a part of the same cluster*  
  *(1) moderate similarity: both firms are family owned but only one of the two is controlled by the family*  
  *(-1) moderate dissimilarity: one of the two firms is family owned (but not controlled) and the counterpart is not*  
  *(-2) high dissimilarity: one of the two firms is non-family owned and the counterpart is family owned and controlled.*  
*degree of family involvement the clusters:*  
  *(A) family owned and family controlled*  
  *(B) family owned*  
  *(C) non-family owned*  
  
  
#### **2.3. Control Variables**  
**State** - State in which the company is established.  
*to check if there is any institutional effect derived from the corporate law of each State and the quality of the enforcement of the contract*  
  
**Relative performance** - absolute value of the difference between the firm’s ROA, divided by the absolute value of the sum of the two firms’ ROA, in the year before the acquisition  
  
**Relative size** - difference in size between the firms  
*absolute value of the difference in total assets between two firms, weighted by the sum of their total assets, in the year before the acquisition*  
  

**Business similarity** - similarity between the industry sectors in which two
firms operate  
*4-digit ATECO codes, Where the codes match at the 4-digit level a similarity value of 4 is assigned, where they match at 3, 2, or 1-digit level, a 3, 2, or 1 is assigned, respectively and 0 otherwise)*  
  
**Similarity Ownership Concentration** - ownership concentration can influence firm’s priorities, decision mechanisms, and in turn, performance  
*ratio between the number of shareholders with more than 2% of shares of the acquiring firm and those of the target firm*  
  
**Geographical similarity** - geographical distance can have negative impact on the likelihood of acquisition between two firms  
*dummy that takes the value of 1 if the two firms belong to the same province and 0 otherwise*  
    
**Industry Concentration** - firms in concentrated markets, particularly in related industries, may be more apt to pursue acquisitions to enhance profit margins  
*concentration of the sectors of the firms using the 8-firm concentration ratios of the two industries at the ATECO 2-digit level*  
  
**Cash Slack** - Acquirer’s cash position  
*current assets of the acquiring firm*  
  
    
### [**H2.**] New Deals and Performance  
#### **2.4. Dependent Variable**  
**New Deal Occurrence** - dummy variable that describes every shares acquisitions until the control.  If an acquisition occurs and the acquiring company did not have control before the operation the dummy assumes value 1. (0 otherwise).  
  
#### **2.5. Indenpendent Variables**  
#### **2.6. Control Variables**  
  
  
  
### [**General Definitions.**]  
**Firm Control** - control is defined if the owner owns at least 50% of the company shares or 25% if the company is listed.
